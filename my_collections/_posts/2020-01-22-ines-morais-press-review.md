The economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has wiped out $3.5 trillion of earnings for millions of people around the world, according to the UN’s labour body. The International Labour Organization (ILO) said income from work declined by an estimated 10.7% in the first three-quarters of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.
