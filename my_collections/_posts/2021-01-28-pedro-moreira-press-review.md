Senolytic drugs are agents that selectively induce apoptosis of senescent cells. These cells accumulate in many tissues with aging and at sites of pathology in multiple chronic diseases. Among the chronic conditions successfully treated by depleting senescent cells in pre-clinical studies are frailty, cardiac dysfunction, vascular hyporeactivity and calcification, diabetes, liver steatosis, osteoporosis, vertebral disk degeneration, pulmonary fibrosis, and radiation-induced damage.
