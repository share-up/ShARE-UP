##### What is it?
ShARE-UP students intend to present a plan for turning an innovative idea into a viable business, by creating a model for the company first steps!

##### What can we offer?
* A team of 2 in-training members and a Senior project lead (Network Manager)
* A ShARE-issued plan/ solution for your business
* Post project follow-up
* Presence in a networking session

##### What do we ask?
* Project responsible to be available for the time period, to assist the students
* A clear and feasible scope related to ShARE scopes - it has to be narrow enough to be solved within 2-3 months. The scope will be defined in an initial project proposal
* Feedback at the end of the project via online form
